                <p>We are a team of geographers, historians, digital humanists and community activists seeking to expose structural racism. We have led community members in the work of unearthing thousands of racial covenants that reserved land for the exclusive use of white people. This allowed us to build a map that shows how these racial restrictions were embedded in the physical landscape. We are expanding the geographic focus of our work to incorporate new communities.</p>

                <p>This research is showing what communities of color have known for decades. Structural barriers stopped many people who were not white from buying property and building wealth for most of the last century.</p>

                <p>In Minneapolis, these restrictions served as powerful obstacles for people of color seeking safe and affordable housing.  They also limited access to community resources like parks and schools. Racial covenants dovetailed with redlining and predatory lending practices to depress homeownership rates for African Americans. Contemporary white residents of Minneapolis like to think their city never had formal segregation. But racial covenants did the work of Jim Crow in northern cities like Minneapolis.</p>

                <p>This history has been willfully forgotten. So we created Mapping Prejudice to shed new light on these historic practices. We cannot address the inequities of the present without an understanding of the past.</p>

                <p>Our work is part of a broader reckoning with the legacies of racist housing policies. Mapping Prejudice was inspired by groundbreaking work in Seattle and Virginia that show how digital tools can illuminate structural racism and transform our understanding of the past.</p>

                <p><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/segregated.htm">Segregated Seattle</a> was the brainchild of the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/segregated.htm">Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project at the University of Washington</a>, which assembled a <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/covenants_database.htm">database</a> of racial covenants that has become an important resource for historians, legal researchers and activists trying to understand how ideas about race shaped real estate law and housing policy.</p>

                <p><a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/36.71/-96.93&opacity=0.8">Mapping Inequality</a> was conceived by the University of Richmond's Digital Lab, which digitized New Deal redlining maps to illuminate how federal policy makers "used racial criteria to categorize lending and insurance risks." Historians have long understood the importance of redlining. Yet by using digital mapping software to organize, analyze and display historic data about this practice, this project retold the story in way that made it accessible for a popular audience.</p>

                <p>Mapping Prejudice builds on this existing work. But our efforts in Minneapolis are made especially urgent by the city's contemporary racial disparities, which are <a href="https://metrocouncil.org/getdoc/03bd679d-21a4-455b-af7a-15309b0c71ae/Diving-Deeper-Understanding-Disparities-Between-B.aspx">some of the largest in the nation</a>. Our initial research shows that covenants created demographic patterns that remain in place in Minneapolis today. Residential segregation reinforces other disparities in employment, education and health care. Most notable is the gap in homeownership rates. While 78 percent of white families own homes in the Twin Cities, only 25 percent of African-American families have title to their dwelling.</p>

                <p>Our initial analysis also draws new attention to the way that race has <a href="http://editions.lib.umn.edu/openrivers/article/mapping-racial-covenants-in-twentieth-century-minneapolis/">shaped public space in the city</a>. Our early maps show that some of the city's most spectacular parks were ringed by residential districts that barred people of color from taking up residence. The result was an invisible racial cordon around the city's renowned Grand Rounds, which serves as the city's urban commons.</p>

                <p>Once completed, our database and map will be a powerful community resource that should serve as a foundation for productive community conversations and fact-based policy making.</p>

                <p>Mapping Prejudice is based in the <a href="https://www.lib.umn.edu/borchert">Borchert Map Library</a> at the University of Minnesota. In 2016, the founding members of the project team joined forces to create the first-ever comprehensive visualization of racial covenants for an American city.</p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">Kirsten Delegard is one of the co-founders of the <a href="https://www.mappingprejudice.org/index.html">Mapping Prejudice Project</a>. She received her Ph.D. in history from Duke University, where she trained as a women's historian. In her early research, she explored the history of women and politics. More recently she has devoted her energy to public history and unearthing the complex past of her hometown, Minneapolis This focus led to Mapping Prejudice and the <a href="http://historyapolis.com/">Historyapolis Project</a>, which Delegard also started.</p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">Mapping Prejudice is located in the John R. Borchert Map Library at the University of Minnesota. Delegard also holds faculty affiliations with the Department of Geography, Environment and Society and the Heritage Studies and Public History Program at the University of Minnesota. She was awarded a fellowship from the National Endowment of the Humanities and has been a <a href="http://sites.mnhs.org/library/legacy-research-fellowships">Legacy Research fellow at the Gale Library</a> at the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">As part of her exploration of the past in Minneapolis, Delegard has written about <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/705736">Prince</a> and the battles over pornography in the city <a href="https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/u-s-womens-history/9780813575834">. She also composed many short pieces for the Historyapolis website.</a></p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">In 2012, the University of Pennsylvania Press published her book, <i>Battling Miss Bolsheviki: The Origins of Female Conservatism in the United States</i>.  This book revisits the 1920s to chart the growth of a conservative women’s movement that would reshape the parameters of female political activism for the remainder of the twentieth century. Delegard was also the co-editor, with Nancy A. Hewitt, for the two volume textbook <i>Women, Families and Communities: Readings in American History</i> (Longman Publishing, 2008). She was also part of the team behind Mary Wingerd’s <i>North Country: The Making of Minnesota</i> (University of Minnesota Press, 2010). Delegard was the image curator for that volume, writing a series of interpretive essays that explained the visuals.</p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding" id="ryan-id">In her spare time, Delegard thinks about writing a new history of Minneapolis that she has tentatively titled <i>City of Light and Darkness: The Making of a Progressive Metropolis in Minneapolis</i></p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">Penny Petersen is one of the co-founders of the Mapping Prejudice Project and is a leading expert on historic property records in Minnesota.</p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">After retiring as a researcher for a Minneapolis-based historical consultant in 2015, Petersen spent countless hours in the Hennepin County Recorder’s Office identifying thousands of deeds encumbered by racial restrictions. This work only intensified after Mapping Prejudice launched its Zooniverse platform for crowd-sourcing deed transcription. Having transcribed more than fifteen thousand property records online, Petersen now leads training sessions for Mapping Prejudice volunteers.</p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">Petersen embraced this effort after Kirsten Delegard requested instruction on finding racially-restricted property deeds in Minneapolis. Delegard was so befuddled by the byzantine organization of property records that Petersen decided it would be easier to do this work herself. She started with the Homewood neighborhood, where activists had long bemoaned the discriminatory barriers erected by restrictive covenants. When <a href="http://www.startribune.com/reputation-for-discrimination-in-north-side-s-homewood-unravels-after-property-study/390763991/">her search proved fruitless</a>, she realized the importance of digging into the archive to uncover where and when racial restrictions were placed on property holdings in Minneapolis.</p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding" id="maggie-id">Petersen has a long-standing interest in the history of  the Minneapolis central riverfront. Her first book, <a href="http://shop.mnhs.org/products/hiding-in-plain-sight-minneapolis-first-neighborhood">Hiding in Plain Sight: Minneapolis’ First Neighborhood</a>, describes the growth of the area around St. Anthony Falls. She also used property records to reconstruct the forgotten world of nineteenth century red-light districts in Minneapolis. She told the story of the powerful women who ran these Mill City establishments in <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/minneapolis-madams">Minneapolis Madams: The Lost History of Prostitution on the Riverfront</a>, which is available from the University of Minnesota Press.

                  <p class="bio-name">Kevin Ehrman-Solberg</p>
                  <p class="bio-title">Digital and Geospatial Director</p>
                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">Mapping Prejudice suffered a significant blow when we <a href="https://www.startribune.com/kevin-ehrman-solberg-mapping-prejudice-project-co-founder-dies-at-33/600069468/?refresh=true">lost our friend and colleague, Kevin Ehrman-Solberg on June 12, 2021</a>. Kevin was one of the co-founders of the Mapping Prejudice Project and a graduate student in the Department of Geography, Environment and Society at the University of Minnesota. </p>

                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">Kevin touched so many lives with his creativity and brilliance. He was instrumental in creating a new methodology for visualizing racial restrictions, unleashing a new flood of interest in racial covenants. We were so fortunate to be able to work with him to create a project that has changed our community for the better.</p>
                
                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">He helped to create Mapping Prejudice while completing his Master of Geographic Information at the University of Minnesota. Kevin built the database necessary for the Mapping Prejudice maps, devising a process to capture volunteer-generated data into points that could be mapped digitally. He also did the initial spatial analysis for the project, showing how covenants changed neighborhood demographics and how they laid the groundwork for later redlining and devastating urban renewal projects.</p>
                
                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">While a lot of Kevin’s work was behind the scenes, he was also an informative, entertaining, and persuasive speaker, capable of moving people to action. His presentations brought so many people to the Mapping Prejudice project. To see Kevin in action, watch his 2018 TEDxMinneapolis presentation, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi50RaTXrSE">The Geography of Inequality</a>.”</p>
                
                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">Kevin was born and raised in the Twin Cities. He began researching the history of pornography theaters in Minneapolis as an undergraduate student at Augsburg University. It was this work that brought him to the Historyapolis Project, where he met Kirsten Delegard and began creating visualizations and narratives about Minneapolis history. An active participant proponent of the “digital humanities,” he interrogated the intersection of <a href="http://historyapolis.com/blog/2016/02/22/minneapolis-is-ruined-the-tunnel-disaster-of-1869/">space and historical narrative</a>. His undergraduate work on <a href="http://mst01mw.muse.jhu.edu/article/631627">pornographic bookstores in Minneapolis</a> -- which explored the connections between pornography, gay sexual liberation, feminism, and police power -- was published in the <i>Middle West Review</i>. Listen to this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-223689921/kevin-ehrman-solberg-web-developer-and-gis-director-for-historyapolis">interview</a> to hear him talk about this research.</p>
                
                  <p class="margin-none bio-padding">Kevin’s many intellectual and political commitments were bound together by his passion for social justice. The uprising that followed the murder of George Floyd supercharged Kevin’s commitment to activism, prompting him to redouble his efforts to provide both practical support and intellectual advocacy for the most vulnerable people in our community. He threw himself into the movement to support the un-housed and was working with other scholars and activists to <a href="https://marketfailure.substack.com/p/private-equity-firms-the-new-landlord">document the abuses of corporate landlords in Minneapolis</a>. He had planned to return to graduate school in the fall of 2021 to work with Professor Kate Derickson to finish his Ph.D. in geography. </p>
