                <p class="model-events-text">Mapping Prejudice's weekly transcription sessions have transitioned to a national focus! Communities across the country are investigating the ways that racial covenants shaped their particular geographies. Mapping Prejudice is thrilled to partner with these communities to help them transcribe and map covenants. Over the last four years, thousands of volunteers have made it possible to map covenants at an unprecedented scale. Now, we are excited to host deeds from other communities around the country. And we hope our amazing volunteers will help us continue the work of challenging structural racism.<br><br>

                  This week, we are featuring the work of our collaborators in South Essex, Massachusetts. We are excited to embark on this new phase of our project, and we hope that you will join us.

So far, our work sessions have been a space focused on the Twin Cities, but starting this week, we will transition to a national focus! Communities across the country are investigating the ways that racial covenants shaped their particular geographies. Mapping Prejudice is thrilled to partner with these communities to help them transcribe and map covenants. Over the last four years, thousands of volunteers have made it possible to map covenants at an unprecedented scale. Now, we are excited to host deeds from other communities around the country. And we hope our amazing volunteers will help us continue the work of challenging structural racism. <br><br>

              The first out-of-state project that we are partnering with is <a href="http://www.mappingsegregationdc.org/">Prologue DC</a> who have been working tirelessly to map covenants in the US capital for years. Public historians, Mara Cherkasky and Sarah Shoenfeld, will join us for this week’s work session to explain their work in DC. Then we will spend the hour transcribing Washington DC deeds. <br><br>

These sessions will be a chance to reflect on what we collectively learned transcribing Ramsey. We will reveal our preliminary covenant map and historical research by our “<a href=" https://welcomingthedearneighbor.org/">Welcoming the Dear Neighbor?</a>” partners! The sessions will also include time for Q&A and community conversation. <br><br>

                If you transcribed deeds for Ramsey County, or if you live in Ramsey County, or if you simply have an interest in this work, we invite you to join one of these sessions to hear what we have learned so far and contribute to the conversation.

              <p class="model-events-text">As our transcription work in Ramsey County nears completion, we are excited to begin incorporating partners in geographies across the country. So far, our work sessions have been a space focused on the Twin Cities, but starting this week, we will transition to a national focus! Communities across the country are investigating the ways that racial covenants shaped their particular geographies. Mapping Prejudice is thrilled to partner with these communities to help them transcribe and map covenants. Over the last four years, thousands of volunteers have made it possible to map covenants at an unprecedented scale. Now, we are excited to host deeds from other communities around the country. And we hope our amazing volunteers will help us continue the work of challenging structural racism. <br><br>

              The first out-of-state project that we are partnering with is <a href="http://www.mappingsegregationdc.org/">Prologue DC</a> who have been working tirelessly to map covenants in the US capital for years. Public historians, Mara Cherkasky and Sarah Shoenfeld, will join us for this week’s work session to explain their work in DC. Then we will spend the hour transcribing Washington DC deeds. <br><br>

              We are excited to embark on this new phase of our project, and we hope that you will join us. </p>

                The Mapping Prejudice Project is mapping racial covenants in the Twin Cities. Racial covenants are clauses--a couple of lines of text--that were embedded into property deeds to bar people who were not white from buying or even occupying the parcels of land to which they were attached.<br><br>
                The project just finished the map of Hennepin County and has turned its attention to Ramsey County.<br><br>
                Covenants were made illegal by the 1968 Fair Housing Act. But their legacy continues today in the Twin Cities, which has some of the largest racial disparities in the country. The Mapping Prejudice Project is designed to reveal the “racism behind these racial disparities,” in the words of Ibram Kendi. It illuminates how structural racism shaped the urban landscape, blocking African Americans from critical avenues for housing stability and wealth accumulation.<br><br>
                Delegard will narrate this history and describe the innovative methodologies used in this work. Together we will explore the question of next steps to address the damage wrought by these policies.<br><br>

                This event is co-hosted by the <a href="https://www.rclreads.org/"><b>Ramsey County Library</b></a>. It is part two of their "Tuesday with a Scholar" series featuring Mapping Prejudice.<br><br>

                To build community awareness about housing injustice, Mapping Prejudice and St. Catherine University are mobilizing volunteers to document racial covenants in Ramsey County. Racial covenants were legal clauses embedded in property deeds that barred people who were not white from buying or occupying land. Elders have known for decades that covenants were widespread. But even with that community wisdom, there is a lot that we don’t know. How common were these restrictions? What areas of our community were reserved for white people only? How much land was restricted in this way? When were they put into place? What did they say? What are the legacies of these practices today? <br><br>

                Help us make a map that can answer these questions. As we do this research together, we will explore the connections between past injustices and present disparities. This is the first step towards meaningful change.<br><br>

                This online training session will teach you what you need to know to contribute to this project.<br><br>

                Two online videos can be helpful as you get ready to do this work.

The film explores the origins of housing segregation in the Minneapolis area and illustrates how African-American families and leaders resisted the practice and built community — within and despite — the red lines that these restrictive covenants created.<br><br>
                The virtual #docuhistory series aims to create an informal space where teachers, students, and historians can join together to watch a documentary and discuss teaching and learning about the film's subject matter. We will all start the movie at the same time, at 4 pm Eastern Standard Time. While viewing the film, please tweet using the #docuhistory hashtag or @ moderators Yohuru Williams @yohuruwilliams and Sari Beth Rosenberg @saribethrose. Feel free to ask questions, make comments and suggestions, and develop discussion threads.<br><br>

                Jim Crow of the North is a documentary that charts the progression of racist policies and practices from the start of restrictive agreements after the turn of the last century to their final elimination in the late 1960s.<br><br>
                When we learn about our shared histories, including racist practices, we deepen our knowledge about how the decisions of earlier generations created the communities we live in today.

              <p class="model-events-text">The pattern of our city is a result of millions of decisions made by planners, policymakers, investors, and individuals over the past 160 years.  But not all decisions have had an equal impact.  Much of who we are as a city is a result of the collective and damaging decisions that systematically excluded people from living in certain neighborhoods.  Banks, homeowners, and developers that engaged in restrictive real estate covenants in the early 20th Century have left a legacy of segregation, inequity and disparities that remain with us today.

                <br><br>February’s Urban Currents will bring together the team that brought this issue to light in recent years through innovative research and storytelling techniques. Please join us!</p>

The Smiths’ artwork consists of urban scenes and portraits that present realist, expressionist, and at times allegorical takes on Black life in America. The works in this exhibition are drawn from their Rondo series—a sprawling body of work that stands as an elegiac anthem for that lost neighborhood and the enduring community that lives on in its wake.”</p>

                Why does Minnesota suffer some of the worst racial disparities in the nation?<br><br>
                One answer is the spread of racist, restrictive real estate covenants in the early 20th century. Jim Crow of the North is based on the work of the University of MN’s research project, Mapping Prejudice.<br><br>
                The panel will include Daniel Pierce Bergin, Jim Crow of the North Producer, and Kirsten Delegard, Mapping Prejudice Project Director. Community members are invited to join the discussion.<br><br>

                <b>A traveling exhibit, "Displaced", will be on display prior to the screening, at 6:00p.m. and the documentary screening will begin at 6:30p.m.</b><br><br>

Structural barriers stopped many people who were not White from buying property and building wealth for most of the last century… Contemporary White residents of Minneapolis like to think their city never had formal segregation. But racial covenants did the work of Jim Crow in northern cities like Minneapolis." – Mapping Prejudice</br></br>

                Through extensive historical research and analysis, Mapping Prejudice has helped to unearth the shameful history of racial covenants and redlining in Minneapolis dating back more than 100 years.</br></br>

                And there is still much work to be done.</br></br>

                On May 2nd, The Sabathani Community is hosting an opening event for the exhibit in its new home and will also be raising funds for the center.<br><br>

                The Sabathani Community Center provides essential social services to the southside area of Minneapolis including a food shelf, clothing closet, job training, and tax preparation services. All proceeds from this event will go towards supporting Sabathani in providing resources for the community.<br><br>

                Make sure to get your tickets and join us for a fun night of entertainment, performances, and a silent auction. Check back here for more upcoming information!<br><br>

                Owning Up: Racism and Housing in Minneapolis explores the history of racial housing discrimination in Minneapolis through the stories of three black families. The exhibit demonstrates the lasting effects of structural discrimination and aims to counter the enduring idea of Minneapolis as a model metropolis.<br><br>

                Why does Minnesota have some of the worst racial disparities in the nation? To understand our contemporary inequities, we need to look to the history of racist, restrictive real estate covenants. A new documentary from Twin Cities PBS tells this story. Jim Crow of the North is based on the work of the Mapping Prejudice Project at the University of Minnesota. This cutting-edge research is documenting, mapping and presenting data on restrictive covenants in the largest metro area in the upper Midwest. The story charts the progression of racist policies and practices from the advent of covenants at the beginning of the twentieth century to the late 1960s. The Twin Cities never had Southern style segregation. But as this work shows, racial covenants were just one aspect of the Jim Crow system of the North.

               Join us for a panel discussion and community conversation about the lifecycle of redlining, disinvestment, predatory lending, and gentrification and displacement — a damaging cycle that runs on racial prejudice and the unregulated flow of extractive capital out of and into communities — and the set of critical interventions from government, communities and businesses that are necessary at each stage of this destructive cycle. This event will lift up the need for community-owned, deeply rooted financial institutions, businesses and housing; for government protections and incentives to make sure that productive, non-extractive services, goods and housing are available to low and moderate income residents during times of disinvestment, and protections for those residents so they are able to remain, thrive and reap the benefits of the influx of capital; and the need for community based advocacy and organizing to hold businesses and investors accountable to make investments that benefit the existing community, rather than profiting from their anticipated and engineered displacement.

               West of Central is set in the Watts neighborhood of Low Angeles, in the aftermath of the urban unrest that roiled more than 150 American cities. The plot turns on the racist housing practices that created the highly segregated--and ultimately explosive--landscape of American cities in the 1960s. After the performance, Mapping Prejudice co-founder, Kirsten Delegard. will be on hand to talk about covenants, redlining and white violence created the racial disparities that we have today in Minneapolis. We look forward to talking with the audience about the connections between the past and the present. In dialogue, we are looking to explore how an awareness of history can help us build a more equitable future.<br><br>
