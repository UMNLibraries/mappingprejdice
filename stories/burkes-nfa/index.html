           <p class="blog-date"></p>


          <p>In 1900, Moses and Mary Burkes bought a little piece of land in the Minneapolis neighborhood now known as Linden Hills. The couple left scant archival records. No letters chronicle their ambition. No diaries reveal their personal challenges or foibles.</p>

          <p>But the property records do speak. They tell us that Moses and Mary were thrifty and capable enough to use their modest earnings as janitors to become freeholders. They bought two lots at the corner 48th and Washburn Avenue South, just a couple blocks from Lake Harriet. On that corner they built a seven-room house, they dug a well, they constructed a barn and a chicken coop.</p>

          <p>The little homestead was more than a collection of modest structures. It became home to Mary's teenage son Louis. It gave the family a way to achieve some economic independence by allowing them to raise some of their own food. And it provided a way for them to support the community institutions they valued. On at least one "Decoration Day"---what we now know as Memorial Day--they hosted a fundraising dinner for their church.</p>

          <p>Moses Burkes came to Minneapolis when he was about 20 years old. He was born in Kentucky around 1866, right after the Civil War, at a moment of heady optimism for African Americans. But by the time Moses was a young man, the shadow of a new racial order had eclipsed the sunny promises of Reconstruction. Whites worked diligently to recreate the conditions of slavery for African Americans. Debt peonage became the rule. Lynchings were commonplace. And the Kentucky legislature wrote Jim Crow rules into law in 1890. It mandated disenfranchisement and legislated racial segregation in schools and public accommodation.</p>

          <p>Moses went north. He traveled to Minnesota, where his half sister Ida promised him work in her growing business.</p>

          <p>Family beckoned but so did freedom. Minnesota seemed to be on a different trajectory than Kentucky. In those years, the state appeared to be the "promised land," in the words of the historian Bill Green. As Jim Crow descended on the south, a commitment to racial equity seemed to grow in Minnesota. The legislature passed new laws guaranteed voting rights for African Americans and equal access to public accommodations. And then, in 1898, voters from South Minneapolis elected an African American to represent them in the Minnesota state legislation.</p>

          <p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, Linden Hills was a logical place for a family like the Burkes to put down roots. Their new home was on the edge of the developing city where property was relatively affordable. It was just a couple of blocks from Lake Harriet, with all of its attractions. And it was served by streetcars, which allowed Mary and Moses to get to their jobs downtown.</p>

              <p class="img-sub-script">This 1914 atlas shows the footprint of the house, barn and chicken coop built by Mary and Moses Burkes at the corner of 48th and Washburn Avenue South. This plate shows that the Burkes had only a smattering of neighbors. Published one year after the family lost the house, the map shows that the buildings remained on lots 16 and 17 of the Lake Harriet Park subdivision after the Burkes left the city. <br><br>

          <p>Three years after the couple bought their property, Mary's mother paid cash for a parcel nearby. She moved her other children and grandchildren to the neighborhood.</p>

          <p>But the ground beneath their reconstructed home began to shift. The "promised land" became hostile territory during the first decades of the twentieth century./p>

          <p>Starting in 1908, white residents around the city began to raise new warnings about the racial contours of the urban landscape. In 1908, Prospect Park rallied against the Jacksons, an African-American family who built a house on what is now Franklin Avenue Southeast. That same year, denizens of Fifth Avenue South organized to remove what they called "undesirable residents" on their street. As B.J. West explained, "A negro is an undesirable resident of a white neighborhood." Residents of Linden Hills mobilized around this same idea in 1909, when they worked to prevent Reverend William S. Malone from buying a house around the corner from the Burkes. The same people would later target Mary's mother, organizing to drive her out of the neighborhood.</p>

          <p>For these civic activists, racial exclusion had become paramount. Minnesota laws that promised equal treatment for people of different races remained intact. But an increasing number of white Minneapolitans had embraced new ideas about neighborhoods. In this new paradigm, established black property owners like the Burkes were an affront to community harmony and prosperity.</p>

          <p>A 1910 editorial in the Minneapolis Journal tried to reconcile these dueling commitments to equal opportunity and racial exclusion. “No one wants to do the negro an injustice,” it declared. But residents will not tolerate African Americans moving into areas where they are unwelcome. It was "dangerous" and would likely lead to violence. The Journal called on the Real Estate Board to address the problem of the city's "considerable negro colony."</p>

          <p>This "colony" included the Burkes, who suffered one set back after another after the fire that took their first house. They were forced to borrow more money. Moses became ill. Their marriage fell apart.</p>

          <p>They moved out of the city. And in 1913 they lost their Linden Hills property.</p>

          <p>There is no sign that neighbors were sad to see them go.</p>

          <p>In 1916, Moses died at St. Barnabas Hospital. He is buried at Lakewood Cemetery, along with other members of his family.</p>
