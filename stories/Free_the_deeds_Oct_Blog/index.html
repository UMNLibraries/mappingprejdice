Diver grew up in the Hale neighborhood of South Minneapolis in a home that had a racial covenant, while Mir&eacute; currently lives in a home that only recently had its covenant discharged. Due to this, Mir&eacute; experiences first-hand how &ldquo;her home and her neighborhood bear the scars of Minneapolis&#39; and our nation&rsquo;s problematic history around race, homeownership, and economic equity.&rdquo; Though racial covenants are no longer legally enforceable, Mir&eacute; does not think discharging racial covenants are without purpose. Instead she believes that the removal of covenants shifts the possible future makeup of a neighborhood through heightened awareness. For Diver, she believes &ldquo;that some change ought to be immediate&rdquo;, and putting up a lawn sign is the least she can do to enact change and address how she may have benefitted from racially restrictive housing practices. However, the hope is that the lawn signs can act as a &ldquo;symbolic act &hellip; &nbsp;a way for people to want to keep going to dig deeper, keep learning, and figure out how they can become a turning point towards equity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Lacey&rsquo;s history with racial covenants happened later on in her life. Growing up in St. Paul, she moved to the East Coast for a few years. However, when she returned to Minneapolis in 2006, she noticed the different ways in which people moved through space. Lacey began to research the history of Minneapolis to make sense of why it looked the way it did. Eventually this led her to Mapping Prejudice, and she hosted the first transcription session for the project in 2017. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">When Lacey, Mir&eacute;, and Diver founded Free the Deeds, they wanted to use the information from Mapping Prejudice to make covenants more visible and work towards the future. As a public art project, they also wanted to present this information in a way that was appealing, accessible, and easy to disseminate. Thus, they came to the idea of lawn signs in yards. Diver sees front yards as &ldquo;places for expression where there are few gatekeepers and where community connections can be made, and where strong statements can occur.&rdquo; Thus, by publicly declaring the removal of a covenant with a lawn sign, a homeowner is making a statement on what they believe their neighborhood -- and city -- should look like. The hope is that the statements from their lawn signs spark conversations between neighbors and the community, asking the question of who the city was built for, and who it is meant for now? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Furthermore, Lacey believes that reflections initiated by these conversations can lead to normalizing the practice of reparations.
